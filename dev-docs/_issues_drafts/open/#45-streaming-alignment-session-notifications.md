## Summary

Replace bespoke `SessionUpdate`, `ContentBlock`, and tool-call structs in `crates/codex-cli-acp` with the official `agent_client_protocol` models. Route all session notifications through `AgentSideConnection::session_notification`, ensuring compatibility with downstream ACP clients.

## Motivation

- Guarantees schema fidelity for agent messages, tool calls, plans, and permission prompts.
- Reduces maintenance overhead by reusing upstream serde definitions.
- Prepares the runtime for composer plugins and richer client UI integration.

## Scope

- Swap custom enums/structs with upstream types in Codex streaming pipeline.
- Update tool-call mapper to emit `ToolCall` and `ToolCallUpdate` with correct status transitions, raw IO payloads, and location metadata.
- Ensure chunk de-duplication logic operates on official types without spamming clients.
- Extend tests to cover tool-call lifecycle, malformed JSON handling, and notify-triggered turn completion.
- Document mapping rules and limitations in `dev-docs/core_servers/acplb-core-runtime.md` or related references.

## Out of Scope

- Introducing composer plugins (future milestone).
- Removing legacy protocol module (handled separately).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Streaming output validated via snapshot tests that assert JSON matches ACP schemas.
- Notify and idle-timeout flows remain intact; Zed client smoke tests pass.
- SDD artefacts (spec/plan/tasks) capture the refactor details and test evidence.

## Dependencies

- Runtime adoption issue merged (shared runtime available).
- Architecture baseline: `dev-docs/architecture/acplb-architecture.md`.

## Evidence Expectations

- Snapshot tests stored under `_artifacts/tests/streaming-alignment/` with diffs vs baseline (legacy mirrors optional under `_artifacts/legacy/`).
- Logs verifying dedupe behaviour under `_artifacts/logs/streaming-alignment/`.
