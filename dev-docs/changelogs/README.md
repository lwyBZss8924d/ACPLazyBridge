# Changelog Guidelines

This directory hosts project-level change logs aligned with the SDD workflow. Use it to document milestone-level updates, release notes, and PR summaries after they merge.

## References

- `sdd-rules/rules/changelog/sdd-rules-changelog.md`
- `sdd-rules/rules/changelog/examples.md`

## Structure

- `YYYY/` (optional) – Group change logs by year if volume increases.
- `<release>-changelog.md` – Narrative release notes.
- `<task>-review.md` – Summaries of merged work (migrated from legacy `dev-docs/review/changes/`).

Each changelog entry should link back to the relevant spec/plan/tasks and evidence in `_artifacts/<task>/`.
