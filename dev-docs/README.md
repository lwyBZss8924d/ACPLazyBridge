# Developer Documentation Index

This directory aggregates non-normative documentation that supports ACPLazyBridge development while remaining aligned with the Specification-Driven Development (SDD) flow.

## Active Collections

- `_issues_drafts/` – Issue research notes and templates used before opening GitHub issues.
- `_requirements/` – Roadmap, requirement briefs, and milestone plans (edit `dev-docs/_requirements/Roadmap.md` to update the project roadmap).
- `_projects/` – Project management plans (e.g., migration blueprint).
- `architecture/` – Current architecture references.
- `core_servers/` – Runtime and server design documents.
- `changelogs/` – Release notes and change history.
- `references/` – External protocol and integration references.
- `CLAUDE.md` – Developer playbook (this document).

## Legacy Materials

- Historical planning and review documents have been archived into the `_artifacts/<type>/legacy/` directories at the repository root.
- Older change notes were migrated to `dev-docs/changelogs/`.
- Do not create new content under the removed `plan/` or `review/` directories; retain the archives solely for historical audits.

> Author new specifications, plans, and tasks under `specs/<NNN>-<slug>/` with evidence stored in `_artifacts/<task>/...`. Consult the SDD Constitution before editing any normative material.
