# ACPLazyBridge Roadmap

This roadmap defines the staged delivery plan for ACPLazyBridge as it evolves into a protocol-compliant bridge, composer, and multi-agent hub built on the official `agent-client-protocol` Rust libraries. Each milestone lists the feature scope, acceptance gates, dependencies, and risks that must be addressed before promotion to the next release track.

## Strategic Goals

- Consolidate every ACPLazyBridge agent server on the upstream ACP runtime to eliminate protocol drift.
- Provide a reusable core that supports Codex first, then additional vendors (Claude, Gemini, etc.) with minimal duplication.
- Deliver composer capabilities (subagents, commands, hooks) that let users stitch specialised agents into coordinated workflows.
- Ship ACP clients and UX integrations (Zed, VS Code, Obsidian, tldraw) that surface bridge functionality consistently.

## Timeline Overview (targeting 2025)

| Quarter | Release | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q3-1 2025 | 0.1.0 | ðŸš§ (ACPLazyBridge) First Release `acp-lazybridge/codex-cli-acp` Core runtime migration to official ACP libraries + Zed â†” Codex-CLI MVP |
| Q3-2 2025 | 0.2.0 | Claude & Gemini agent servers on shared runtime + composer plugin foundation |
| Q4-1 2025 | 0.3.0 | Cross-editor ACP clients (VS Code, Obsidian, tldraw) + advanced composer workflows |
| Q4-2 2025 | 0.4.0 | Runtime hardening, multi-agent orchestration, and ecosystem SDK polish |

> Dates are directional; release readiness is gated by SDD acceptance criteria and CI evidence rather than calendar targets.

## Milestone 0.1.0 â€“ Core Runtime & Zed â†” Codex-CLI MVP `acp-lazybridge/codex-cli-acp`

**Scope**

- âœ… **Completed**: Replace handcrafted JSON-RPC loop with `agent_client_protocol::AgentSideConnection` and Tokio `LocalSet` execution (SDD Task 038, PR #47).
- âœ… **Completed**: Port streaming notifications to official `SessionNotification`, `ContentBlock`, `ToolCall`, and `ToolCallUpdate` types (Issue #45, Phase 4).
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Complete Codex protocol alignment for the MVP, Enhanced Implementation Plan for ACPLazyBridge `acp-lazybridge/codex-cli-acp`, covering submission metadata, tool lifecycle, approvals, and slash commands with official ACP models ([Issue #52](https://github.com/lwyBZss8924d/ACPLazyBridge/issues/52), supersedes Issue #46).
- âœ… **Completed**: Validate end-to-end with Zed's Custom Agent client connected to the Codex CLI adapter.

**Acceptance**

- âœ… **Completed**: CI (`scripts/ci/run-local-ci.sh`) is green and replayed JSONL scenarios match ACP schema snapshots.
- âœ… **Completed**: SDD spec/plan/tasks documented for runtime migration via `specs/038-adopt-acp-runtime/`.
- âœ… **Completed**: Evidence artefacts stored under `_artifacts/038-adopt-acp-runtime/` with test logs, performance benchmarks, and SDD validation reports.

**Risks & Mitigations**

- âœ… **Resolved**: Tokio `!Send` futures confined inside `LocalSet`; integration tests added and passing.
- âœ… **Resolved**: CLI parity maintained via snapshot tests and permission mapping validation.

## Milestone 0.2.0 â€“ Multi-Agent Runtime & Composer Foundations

**Scope**

- Implement Claude and Gemini adapters on the shared runtime; reuse process transport and permission policies.
- Introduce `acplb-subagents`, `acplb-commands`, and `acplb-hooks` plugin primitives with the first shipping plugin: `acplb-subagent-translator`.
- Provide configuration contract (TOML/JSON) for registering subagents, ordering hooks, and mapping permission modes.
- Extend test harnesses to orchestrate parallel sessions and plugin pipelines.

**Acceptance**

- Claude and Gemini binaries pass the same ACP smoke scenarios as Codex, including tool-call lifecycle and cancellation tests.
- Composer plugin configured in CI to translate prompts via a subagent and reinject responses.
- Documentation updates in `dev-docs/core_servers/` and `dev-docs/architecture/` describing runtime extension points and plugin APIs.

**Risks & Mitigations**

- _Vendor CLI updates_: pin tool versions via workspace toolchain manifests; include compatibility matrix in references.
- _Plugin ordering bugs_: create deterministic plugin execution tests with golden outputs.

## Milestone 0.3.0 â€“ Cross-Editor Clients & Advanced Composer Workflows

**Scope**

- Build ACPLazyBridge client integrations for VS Code (fork of Copilot Chat or Cline), Obsidian, and tldraw.
- Expand composer toolkit with workflow templates (e.g., planner â†’ executor â†’ reviewer chains) and richer telemetry.
- Add multi-session orchestration so one master agent can orchestrate subagent task queues.

**Acceptance**

- Each client extension implements ACP configuration, session lifecycle, and tool-permission UI with manual test scripts archived.
- Composer workflows documented with BPMN-like diagrams and validated through automated JSONL playbacks.
- Observability hooks (metrics/logging) emit per-session timelines for debugging.

**Risks & Mitigations**

- _Editor marketplace policies_: maintain forks in a dedicated org, track upstream changes via scheduled dependency audits.
- _User experience fragmentation_: define UX guidelines in `dev-docs/architecture/` to keep agent panels consistent.

## Milestone 0.4.0 â€“ Ecosystem Hardening & SDK Polish

**Scope**

- Publish Rust SDK crates for building third-party ACPLazyBridge plugins and agent servers.
- Provide TypeScript bindings for composer APIs to support browser-based integrations.
- Harden runtime with resource quotas, tracing correlation IDs, and structured error propagation.

**Acceptance**

- SDK examples and tutorials available in `dev-docs/references/` with runnable code samples.
- Load testing artefacts stored under `_artifacts/reports/` showing graceful degradation and recovery strategies.

## Cross-Cutting Initiatives

- **Security**: enforce sandbox policies, redact sensitive data, and document audit trails for CLI interactions.
- **Testing**: continue expanding JSONL scenario library; add chaos tests covering notify timeouts and abrupt CLI exits.
- **Documentation**: every milestone requires refreshed SDD specs/plans/tasks plus roadmap deltas recorded here.

## Dependencies & External Signals

- agent-client-protocol crate updates (watch releases â‰¥0.4.0 for breaking changes).
- Provider CLI roadmaps (Codex, Claude, Gemini) for feature parity and authentication changes.
- Editor extension APIs (Zed, VS Code, Obsidian, tldraw) to ensure compatibility with UX/permission flows.

## Tracking & Governance

- Roadmap evolution is governed by the SDD Constitution; updates require spec/plan/task artefacts and adherence to the Constitution Update Checklist when touching normative documents.
- Each milestone is managed through GitHub Projects with links to specs, plans, tasks, and evidence folders:
    - **Project #7**: [Milestone 0.1.0 - Core Runtime & Codex MVP](https://github.com/users/lwyBZss8924d/projects/7)
    - **Setup Guide**: [github-projects-setup.md](./github-projects-setup.md) (detailed configuration)
    - **Quick Start**: [PROJECT-QUICKSTART.md](./PROJECT-QUICKSTART.md) (5-minute guide)
- Deviations from scope require explicit approval recorded in `sdd-rules` change logs.
