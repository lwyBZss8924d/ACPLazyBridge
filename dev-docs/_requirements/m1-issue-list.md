## How to Use This Index

1. **Before opening an issue** â€“ start from the corresponding draft in `_issues_drafts/` and ensure the status above aligns with reality.
2. **When updating status** â€“ edit both the issue draft and this table (or retire the row once the milestone closes).
3. **For evidence** â€“ collect logs/tests under `_artifacts/<task>/...`; legacy references (`_artifacts/tests/legacy/`) are read-only.
