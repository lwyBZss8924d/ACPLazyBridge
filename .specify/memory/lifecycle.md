# Lifecycle (Authoritative)

This lifecycle defines the end-to-end workflow for every task (human or AI engineer).

ðŸ“Œ Wen any AI-Engineer SDD-TASKs Cooking Workflow can follow the BASELINE TEMPLATES work in (specs/): [AI-Engineer-SDD-Workflow-Baseline-templates](.specify/memory/AI-Engineer-SDD-Workflow-Baseline-templates.txt)

## CONSTITUTION - Supplementary Baseline

This section serves as the projectâ€™s "CONSTITUTION - Supplementary Baseline" and is maintained in this file (.specify/memory/lifecycle.md) per your directive. Teams may softlink or reference this section where "Supplementary Baseline" is expected.

### Operating base Rules

- CLI Tools: when using any command line tools, avoid interactive/paged commands; never expose secrets.
- Command allowlist & MCP servers: defer to <DeveloperTeamMembers AI-Engineer (Agents)>; do not duplicate here.
- Worktree-first: never develop on main; create a feature branch in a dedicated worktree.
- Branch categories (canonical): feature | fix | perf | chore | docs (kebab-case). The feature/<module>-<id> style is allowed as an alternative but not the canonical example.
- Logging discipline: stderr for logs; stdout reserved for JSON-RPC/JSONL only.
- Evidence: store all local scenario outputs and jq validations under _artifacts/{tests,logs,jq,reports}/<task>/.
- Respect human edits: do not override user modifications unless explicitly requested; reconcile conflicts conservatively.

### SDD compliance (must do for every task)

work in: (specs/)

- Create an SDD record under specs/<NNN>-<slug>/ with:
    - spec.md (WHAT/WHY; requirements and acceptance)
    - plan.md (technical plan; architecture and trade-offs)
    - tasks.md (subtasks, responsibilities, test plan)
- Add the following metadata block at the top of each file (and mirror in the GitHub Issue body):
    - Issue-URI: <link to the GitHub issue>
    - Spec-URI / Plan-URI / Tasks-URI: <self links>
    - Evidence-URIs: _artifacts/{tests,logs,jq,reports}/<task>/... linked with (specs/) TASK's artifacts outputs.
- PR description must include: links to Spec/Plan/Tasks, evidence files (tests/logs/jq/reports), risks/rollback, and CI pass summary.

### SDD commands (artifact generation)

- /specify â€” generate a new feature specification and branch/worktree; see sdd-rules/commands/specify.md
- /plan â€” create implementation plan and design docs; see sdd-rules/commands/plan.md
- /tasks â€” derive executable tasks from the plan; see sdd-rules/commands/tasks.md
- /sdd-task â€” initialize SDD task from GitHub issue; see .specify/commands/sdd-task.md

Notes:

- Use these commands to maintain the spec â†’ plan â†’ tasks flow described in (.specify/spec-driven.md) and (.specify/memory/lifecycle.md).

### Standard procedure

1) Context gathering
   - Inspect repository state, read relevant files, and list existing workflows.
2) Plan tasks
   - Draft a concise checklist; create a feature worktree from origin/main.
3) Implement & verify
   - Code changes via patch; run fmt/clippy/test; replay JSONL scenarios; record evidence.
4) Evidence
   - Store (specs/) TASK's artifacts outputs linked to (_artifacts/{tests,logs,jq,reports}/<task>/...; summarize pass/fail and link (specs/) TASK's (specs/) artifacts.
5) PR & merge
   - Open PR with summary and evidence; on approval, squash-merge and clean up worktrees.
   - After merge: MUST re-run the SDD Documentation Dynamic Consistency Check Workflow (.specify/memory/constitution_update_checklist.md) first! Then if needed to add any new sdd-rules or update .specify/memory/constitution.md and resync docs/templates if needed.

### SDD Rules

**SDD-RULES**: When AI engineers update the (specs/) Initialize Tasks & Process Tasks workflow process in accordance with the requirements and in strict compliance with the CONSTITUTION & "CONSTITUTION" - Link outher SDD decs, the SDD artifact: spec.md / plan.md / task.md needs to be explicitly linked to the specific rules (sdd-rules/rules/) {ssd-rules-xxx} if it needs to refer to specific rules. plan.md / task.md need to explicitly link to specific rules when (sdd-rules/rules/) {ssd-rules-xxx}

### Branch and worktree (canonical example)

For every formal TASK (e.g., `specs/<NNN>-<slug>/`), create a new worktree and branch off `origin/main`. (specs/) TASK's worktree branch Use existing GitHub Issues or create new ones, along with corresponding PRs, to track and manage the TASKâ€™s status and progress any Issues and PRs comments fllow GitHub best practices.

- Branch categories: feature | fix | perf | chore | docs
- Create a new worktree and branch from origin/main:
  git -C /Users/arthur/dev-space/ACPLazyBridge worktree add /Users/arthur/dev-space/acplb-worktrees/<task-dir> origin/main -b <branch>
- Optional IDE navigation:
  ln -sfn /Users/arthur/dev-space/acplb-worktrees/<task-dir> /Users/arthur/dev-space/ACPLazyBridge/.worktrees/<task-dir>

### Quality gates (must pass)

- cargo fmt --all -- --check
- cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
- cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
- Protocol JSONL scenarios (if present) replay without errors; stdout is valid JSONL.
- Code scanning (GitHub Code Scanning) is enabled.

### Constitutional gates (must pass)

- Library-First (Article I): Every feature begins as a standalone library or crate. See .specify/memory/constitution.md
- CLI Interface (Article II): Libraries expose CLI entrypoints with text I/O contracts. See .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Test-First (Article III): Write tests first and confirm failing (RED) before implementation. See .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Integration Testing (Article IV): Integration tests for contracts, cross-process workflows, and protocol behaviors. See .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Observability (Article V): stdout for protocol only; stderr for logs; structured logging for evidence. See .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Versioning (Article VI): Semantic versioning; documented breaking changes and migration paths. See .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Simplicity (Article VII): â‰¤3 projects; no future-proofing; avoid unnecessary patterns. See .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Anti-Abstraction (Article VIII): Use framework features directly; single model representation. See .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Integration-First (Article IX): Contracts defined; contract tests written before implementation; use real dependencies where practical. See .specify/memory/constitution.md

### SDD checks (pre-PR)

- scripts/ci/run-local-ci.sh â€” runs structure, language, markdown, semantic, and metadata checks
- Or on macOS, run individually:
    - scripts/sdd/validate-sdd-docs.sh â€” comprehensive SDD document validation (templates, metadata, structure)
    - scripts/sdd/check_language.sh â€” English-only policy enforcement
    - scripts/sdd/lint_docs.sh â€” markdown linting
    - scripts/sdd/run_semantic_checks.sh â€” cross-reference validation
    - scripts/sdd/validate-metadata.sh â€” validate YAML metadata format
    - scripts/sdd/check-sdd-consistency.sh â€” check global consistency

- Before submitting a PR, run the scripts in (scripts/sdd/) to perform the SDD consistency check and ensure compliance for (specs/) TASK's artifacts.

### Security & compliance

- Do not log secrets; never print secrets to CI logs; use env vars and GitHub secrets.
- Avoid running untrusted code or scripts without review.

### Communication

- Keep status short and actionable; when uncertain about intent, ask before proceeding.
- Escalate risks with options and trade-offs.

### SDD Team Workflows

#### New Feature Workflow (spec â†’ plan â†’ tasks â†’ code)

1. **warp**: Coâ€‘define requirements with human devs; capture the WHAT and WHY (no HOW). If needed, open/triage a GitHub Issue.
2. **warp**: Create a feature branch and worktree (autoâ€‘numbered) and initialize `specs/NNN-feature/` using `/specify` or `/sdd-task <issue>` for issue-based initialization.
3. **claude**: Generate implementation plan via `/plan`, producing `plan.md`, and supporting docs (`data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `research.md`, `quickstart.md`).
4. **warp**: Validate plan against SDD gates (Simplicity, Antiâ€‘Abstraction, Integrationâ€‘First, Testâ€‘First). Mark ambiguities as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`.
   - Libraryâ€‘First Gate (Article I):
     - [ ] Feature implemented as a library first (package/module skeleton present)
     - [ ] Minimal testable structure exists (contract/integration scaffolds)
     - [ ] Build/test jobs include the library target
   - CLI Interface Gate (Article II):
     - [ ] CLI entrypoint(s) defined and discoverable (`<tool> --help`)
     - [ ] CLI supports stdin/stdout and JSON for structured IO
     - [ ] CLI contract tests present (help/usage snapshot + sample IO cases)
   - Integration Testing Gate (Article IV):
     - [ ] Integration tests written for new contracts
     - [ ] Cross-process workflows have test scenarios
     - [ ] Protocol/JSONL behaviors tested with realistic data
   - Observability Gate (Article V):
     - [ ] stdout reserved for protocol/tool output only
     - [ ] All logs directed to stderr
     - [ ] Structured logging configured for evidence capture
   - Versioning Gate (Article VI):
     - [ ] Version increment follows semantic versioning
     - [ ] Breaking changes documented with migration notes
     - [ ] Deprecation paths clearly defined
5. **claude**: Generate executable `tasks.md` via `/tasks`. Mark parallelizable tasks.
6. **claude**: Implement via strict TDD (contract â†’ integration â†’ e2e â†’ unit), only writing code to make tests pass.
7. **warp**: Review artifacts in `specs/NNN-feature/`, update progress, and link the branch/commits to the Issue.
8. **warp**: Run local checks (structure, language policy, semantic, template drift). Push branch and open PR.
9. **warp + claude**: Monitor CI, process PR review, keep specs/tasks in sync with requested changes.
10. **warp**: Merge, clean up worktree, pull main, run SDD consistency pass, and update teamâ€‘wide SDD docs if required.

#### Bug Fix Workflow (specâ€‘first, reproductionâ€‘driven)

Use the feature workflow adapted for bug reproduction and prevention. Code changes must be specificationâ€‘driven, not patchâ€‘first.

1. **warp**: Open/triage a GitHub Issue. Create a bugfix worktree/branch `NNN-bug-[slug]`.
2. **warp**: In `specs/NNN-bug-[slug]/spec.md`, document:
   - Title, context, impacted versions, severity
   - Minimal Reproduction Steps (MRS)
   - Expected vs. Actual behavior
   - Scope (components, contracts, data)
   - Nonâ€‘functional impacts (perf, security, compatibility)
3. **claude**: Generate `plan.md` with rootâ€‘cause hypotheses and proposed fix strategies. Record validation points and potential regressions.
4. **claude**: Write failing tests first derived from MRS (contract/integration/e2e). No implementation until tests are red.
5. **claude**: Implement the fix to make tests pass; update contracts if behavior is clarified. Keep changes minimal per Simplicity/Antiâ€‘Abstraction gates.
   - If the fix touches behavior contracts:
     - [ ] Update CLI help/usage and examples accordingly
     - [ ] Update CLI contract tests (help snapshot + sample IO)
     - [ ] Record rationale and impact in `spec.md`/`plan.md`
   - If the fix affects integration points (Article IV):
     - [ ] Update integration tests
     - [ ] Verify protocol behavior unchanged
   - If the fix affects logging/output (Article V):
     - [ ] Maintain stdout/stderr discipline
     - [ ] Update structured logging if needed
   - If the fix introduces breaking changes (Article VI):
     - [ ] Follow semantic versioning
     - [ ] Provide migration guide
6. **warp**: Ensure the change lands in a replaceable library unit (Article I) and the CLI surface remains consistent (Article II).
7. **warp**: Update `tasks.md` for the bugfix, mark status, and link commit messages to the Issue `[BUG-NNN]` (or `[TASK-XXX]` if unified).
8. **warp**: Run local CI (structure, language, semantic, drift). Push branch and open PR with reproduction, fix rationale, and test evidence.
9. **warp + claude**: Address PR feedback. If the bug implies spec ambiguity, update feature specs to remove `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers systemâ€‘wide.
10. **warp**: Merge, clean up branch. Backport if needed. Update CHANGELOG/Release notes.

#### SDD Documentation & CI Dynamic Consistency Update Workflow

Purpose: keep specifications, plans, tasks, and CI checks aligned with reality after any change (feature, fix, or refactor).

1. **Triggering Events**
   - PR merged to main; upstream template changes; ecosystem/library updates; constitution amendments; recurring drift or semantic alerts.

2. **Detection & Audit (local/CI)**
   - Run `scripts/ci/run-local-ci.sh` or enhanced `scripts/ci/run-sdd-gates.sh` to execute:
     - SDD structure lint (required directories, files)
     - Language policy (Englishâ€‘only for normative artifacts)
     - Markdown lint (style, links)
     - Template drift (compare against upstream or pinned ref)
     - Semantic checks (broken crossâ€‘refs, placeholders, `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`)
     - **Metadata validation** (`scripts/sdd/validate-metadata.sh`): YAML syntax, required fields, constitution version
     - **Consistency checks** (`scripts/sdd/check-sdd-consistency.sh`): document dependencies, cross-references
     - **AST-grep scanning** (`ast-grep scan -c sgconfig.yml`): code quality rules with SARIF reporting
     - Libraryâ€‘First conformance (Article I): library modules present; packaging/build targets configured
     - CLI conformance (Article II): entrypoints exist and are executable; `--help` output matches documented usage/examples
     - Integration Testing conformance (Article IV): integration tests present and passing
     - Observability conformance (Article V): stdout/stderr properly separated; logs captured as evidence
     - Versioning conformance (Article VI): version numbers follow semver; breaking changes documented

3. **Documentation Sync**
   - For any deviation, update `specs/*/(spec|plan|tasks).md` and supporting docs (`research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`).
   - If CI workflows or governance changed, update `dev-docs/sdd/*` and projectâ€‘level `WARP.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
   - Ensure updates are minimal and traceable; link Issues/PRs.

4. **Template & Manifest Alignment (optional)**
   - If improvements are generic, promote them into the template set under `templates/` (not repositoryâ€‘specific roots).
   - Record template version and migration notes. Prepare `templates diff`/`templates update`.

5. **Validation & Publication**
   - Reâ€‘run local checks. Open a PR focused on doc/CI consistency. Ensure passing SDD gates.
   - On merge, if templates changed, cut a release of templates (not repositoryâ€‘specific content). Communicate channel (stable/canary).

6. **Roles**
   - **warp**: Orchestrates audits, updates normative docs, drives CI corrections, opens/merges doc PRs.
   - **claude**: Proposes concrete doc changes from diffs and runtime evidence; generates checklists and regression tests.

Outcome: documentation, plans, tasks, and CI checks remain a living, executable representation of the system, continuously synchronized with the implementation and upstream norms.

#### Metadata Validation Workflow

Purpose: Ensure all SDD documents maintain consistent YAML metadata for automated validation and querying.

1. **Metadata Structure**
   All SDD documents must include YAML metadata at the document footer:

   ```yaml
   constitution:
       version: "1.0.1"
       last_checked: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
   document:
       type: "document-type"
       path: "./relative/path.md"
       version: "X.Y.Z"
       last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
       dependencies:
           - "dependency1.md"
   ```

2. **Validation Tools**
   - `scripts/sdd/validate-metadata.sh`: Validate individual or all files
   - `scripts/sdd/query-metadata.sh`: Query documents by metadata fields
   - `scripts/sdd/check-sdd-consistency.sh`: Global consistency validation
   - `scripts/sdd/migrate-to-yaml-metadata.sh`: Migrate to unified format

3. **CI Integration**
   Metadata validation runs automatically:
   - On every PR modifying .md files
   - After merge to main
   - During `scripts/ci/run-local-ci.sh` execution

4. **Common Operations**

   ```bash
   # Validate all metadata
   ./scripts/sdd/validate-metadata.sh --check-consistency

   # Find outdated documents
   ./scripts/sdd/query-metadata.sh --outdated 30

   # Check global consistency
   ./scripts/sdd/check-sdd-consistency.sh --verbose

   # Migrate formats if needed
   ./scripts/sdd/migrate-to-yaml-metadata.sh --dry-run
   ```

5. **Roles**
   - **warp**: Monitors metadata consistency, triggers validation checks
   - **claude**: Updates metadata during document changes, runs validation tools
