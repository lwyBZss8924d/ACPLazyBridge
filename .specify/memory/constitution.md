# "ACPLazyBridge" SDD CONSTITUTION

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### PRINCIPLE I. Library-First

Every feature begins as a standalone library or crate. No application-first implementations.
Libraries must be self-contained, testable independently, and documented.
Where applicable, expose a minimal public API with clear semantics.

### PRINCIPLE II. CLI Interface

Each library exposes functionality via a CLI entrypoint when meaningful.
Text I/O contract: accept input via stdin/args/files; produce output on stdout;
diagnostics go to stderr.
Support JSON for structured IO when applicable;
provide human-readable output as needed.

### PRINCIPLE III. Test-First (Non-Negotiable)

Tests are written and validated before implementation (RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR).
Contract and integration tests must exist prior to implementation of behavior.
No code is committed without failing tests first demonstrating intent.

### PRINCIPLE IV. Integration Testing

Integration tests are required for:

- New library contracts and any change to existing contracts
- Cross-process or inter-crate workflows
- Protocol/JSONL behaviors and error handling
Prefer contract tests and realistic environments over mocks where practical.

### PRINCIPLE V. Observability

stdout is reserved exclusively for protocol/JSONL or tool output;
all logs go to stderr.
Use structured logging where practical and capture logs as evidence during
CI/local runs.

### PRINCIPLE VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes

Follow semantic versioning for published artifacts and document breaking changes.
Provide migration notes and clear deprecation paths for breaking changes.

### PRINCIPLE VII. Simplicity

Favor the simplest implementation that satisfies requirements.
â‰¤ 3 projects for initial implementation; additional projects require
justification and approval.
No speculative features or premature abstractions.

### PRINCIPLE VIII. Anti-Abstraction

Prefer framework/library features directly; avoid unnecessary wrappers and indirection.
Maintain a single model representation; avoid parallel model hierarchies unless justified.

### PRINCIPLE IX. Integration-First

Define contracts before implementation; write contract tests first.
Prefer real dependencies and realistic IO paths where practical during testing.

## IMPORTANT TECHNICAL STANDARDS

- [ACP](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol) - "ACPLazyBridge" follow `ACP` Protocol
- [ACP JSON Schema](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/blob/main/schema/schema.json) - "ACPLazyBridge" follow `ACP` JSON Schema

## ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS

### AUTHORITY AND PRECEDENCE

- This Constitution is authoritative for project-wide SDD governance.
- Rule precedence: project rules with file paths override personal rules;
  subdirectory rules override parent directory rules; when multiple rules conflict,
  the later rule in the ordered list takes precedence.
- Normative artifacts (specifications/plans/tasks/issues/PRDs/commits) must be
  written in English.

### LANGUAGE POLICY

Normative artifacts must be English-only. Non-normative references may be
multilingual with clear disclaimers.

### SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

Never log secrets or print them in CI; use environment variables and GitHub secrets.
Avoid running untrusted code or scripts without review.

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW, REVIEW PROCESS, QUALITY GATES

### QUALITY GATES (must pass)

- cargo fmt --all -- --check
- cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
- cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
- Protocol JSONL scenarios (if present) replay without errors; stdout is valid
  JSONL; logs to stderr.
- Security scanning is enabled.

### PRE-PR CHECKS

- scripts/ci/run-local-ci.sh (or component scripts):
    - scripts/ci/run-sdd-structure-lint.sh
    - scripts/ci/check-language-policy.sh
    - scripts/ci/run-markdown-style.sh
    - scripts/sdd/run_semantic_checks.sh

### BRANCHING & WORKTREES

- Worktree-first: never develop on main; use feature/fix/perf/chore/docs/<kebab-slug>.
- Canonical worktree command:

  ```bash
  git -C /Users/arthur/dev-space/ACPLazyBridge worktree add /Users/arthur/dev-space/acplb-worktrees/<task-dir> origin/main -b <branch>
  ```

### EVIDENCE & LOGGING

- Store evidence under _artifacts/{tests,logs,jq,reports}/<task>/.
- Keep logs and test outputs with timestamps for reproducibility.

## GOVERNANCE

This Constitution supersedes all other practices in case of conflict.
Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.

### GOVERNANCE RULES

- All PRs/reviews must verify compliance
- Complexity must be justified
