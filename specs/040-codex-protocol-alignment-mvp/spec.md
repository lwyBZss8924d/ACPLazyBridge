- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a** Zed IDE user leveraging Codex CLI for AI-assisted development
**I want** complete workflow support including file operations, approvals, and status commands
**So that** I can use all Codex CLI features seamlessly within my IDE without switching contexts

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a Zed project with files to edit, **When** Codex proposes file changes, **Then** I see real-time diffs and can approve/reject each operation within Zed's UI

2. **Given** Codex needs to execute a shell command, **When** approval is required, **Then** I receive an approval prompt with command details and can approve/deny without leaving the IDE

3. **Given** I'm in an active Codex session, **When** I type `/status` as a slash command, **Then** I receive current session information (model, approval policy, sandbox mode) displayed in the chat

4. **Given** Codex wants to read a file using MCP tools, **When** the file operation executes, **Then** the operation transparently uses Zed's native file system capabilities via the bridge

5. **Given** Codex generates a plan with multiple steps, **When** the plan updates, **Then** I see structured plan entries with status (pending/in_progress/completed) and priorities in Zed's UI

6. **Given** Codex produces reasoning text, **When** reasoning sections stream, **Then** I see accumulated reasoning with proper aggregation and de-duplication

7. **Given** a long-running Codex operation, **When** Codex emits tool progress updates, **Then** I see real-time status transitions (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed/failed) with output previews

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** the MCP bridge TCP server encounters a port conflict?
  ‚Üí System automatically retries with a different OS-assigned port

- **What happens when** Codex CLI crashes mid-session?
  ‚Üí Bridge cleanup occurs, session terminates gracefully, error reported to user

- **What happens when** a tool output exceeds 10KB?
  ‚Üí Output is truncated with metadata flags indicating truncation and total size

- **What happens when** user submits an invalid slash command like `/unknown`?
  ‚Üí System responds with available commands list and usage hints

- **What happens when** ACP client filesystem API is unavailable?
  ‚Üí MCP bridge falls back to local filesystem operations with proper error handling

- **What happens when** approval flow times out?
  ‚Üí Operation fails gracefully, timeout logged, user notified

- **FR-024**: System MUST preserve context metadata in a format ACP clients can understand

#### Tool Lifecycle

- **FR-025**: System MUST notify clients when patch operations start and complete
- **FR-026**: System MUST notify clients when file operations start and complete
- **FR-027**: System MUST preserve original tool inputs and outputs with file locations
- **FR-028**: System MUST limit output preview sizes while indicating when truncation occurs
- **FR-029**: System MUST accurately classify tool operations by their purpose (execute, read, write, edit, delete, move, search, think, fetch, other)

#### Quality & Testing

- **FR-030**: System MUST work with multiple Codex CLI communication formats
- **FR-031**: System MUST include test fixtures covering all event types
- **FR-032**: System MUST demonstrate bridge connectivity and file operation correctness through automated tests
- **FR-033**: System MUST verify command parsing and execution through automated tests
- **FR-034**: System MUST collect test evidence and validation artifacts for review

#### Documentation

- **FR-035**: System MUST update project documentation to reflect completed work
- **FR-036**: System MUST indicate which previous work items are replaced by this feature
- **FR-037**: System MUST provide visual architecture documentation

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Bridge overhead MUST be less than 5ms per operation
- **NFR-002**: System MUST handle bridge process crashes with automatic cleanup
- **NFR-003**: System MUST provide clear error messages for MCP protocol incompatibilities
- **NFR-004**: System MUST never log secrets or sensitive information
- **NFR-005**: System MUST use structured logging to stderr (stdout reserved for JSON-RPC)
- **NFR-006**: System MUST comply with SDD Constitution principles (Test-First, Library-First, Integration-First)

### Key Entities
