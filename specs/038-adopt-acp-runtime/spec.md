## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer using ACPLazyBridge, I want the Codex adapter to use the official ACP runtime implementation so that protocol compliance is guaranteed and future ACP features are automatically available without custom parsing logic.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an existing JSONL scenario file, **When** the new runtime processes it, **Then** the output matches the baseline without regression
2. **Given** a session with notify configured, **When** a turn completion signal arrives, **Then** the session ends immediately without waiting for idle timeout
3. **Given** a session without notify, **When** no output occurs for the idle timeout period, **Then** the session ends with stopReason "end_turn"
4. **Given** permission mode settings, **When** creating a new session, **Then** the appropriate CLI overrides are applied to the Codex process
5. **Given** a cancellation request, **When** sent during an active session, **Then** the child process terminates and returns stopReason "cancelled"
6. **Given** `ACPLB_EVIDENCE_PATH` is set, **When** a session initializes, prompts, or cancels, **Then** the runtime appends structured telemetry events to the configured evidence file

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the agent-client-protocol crate is unavailable?
- How does system handle malformed JSONL input with the new runtime?
- What occurs if LocalSet execution fails or deadlocks?
- How does runtime behave under high concurrent session load?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements (Roadmap Alignment)

- **Roadmap FR-0101**: ACPLazyBridge MUST run each prompt turn through the official ACP runtime so that downstream clients receive protocol-accurate responses without bespoke JSON parsing.
- **Roadmap FR-0104**: JSONL scenario replays MUST remain backward compatible, giving stakeholders confidence that existing workflows operate unchanged after the migration.
- **Roadmap FR-0105**: Notify hooks and idle timeout behavior MUST mirror the legacy bridge so on-call teams do not lose operational safeguards already validated in production.
- **Derived FR-038-01**: Permission decisions MUST continue to translate ACP permission modes into Codex CLI overrides, preserving access control guardrails promised to IDE integrators.
- **Derived FR-038-02**: The runtime MUST provide reusable session and notification primitives so the Claude and Gemini adapters planned for Milestone 0.2.0 can adopt the same foundation without rework.
- **Derived FR-038-03**: Operational telemetry (structured logs, JSONL transcripts, evidence bundles) MUST remain available‚Äîincluding runtime-emitted evidence when `ACPLB_EVIDENCE_PATH` is configured‚Äîto satisfy SDD Article III verification requirements.

### Key Outcomes & Stakeholder Impacts

- **Reliability**: The bridge presents the same stop reasons, notifications, and idle timeout behavior developers already scripted against, eliminating retraining costs for client teams.
- **Extensibility**: Future provider adapters plug into shared runtime capabilities, reducing time-to-market for roadmap items FR-0201 and beyond.
- **Governance**: Telemetry and evidence capture keep SDD validation auditable, enabling reviewers to trace behavior back to signed-off artefacts.
