## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úì CI integration with SDD gates and ast-grep scanning
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, CI system, reviewers
   ‚Üí Actions: validate, scan, report, enforce
   ‚Üí Data: code, test results, scan findings
   ‚Üí Constraints: two-stage rollout, dependency on Issue #31
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No critical ambiguities identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úì Clear user flow: PR submission triggers CI checks
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úì Requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí CI workflow, scan results, quality reports
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   ‚Üí No implementation details in requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer submitting a pull request, I need automated validation of my code against project quality standards and security rules, so that issues are caught early and the codebase maintains consistent quality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a PR is opened with code changes, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** SDD structure validation, code analysis, and quality checks execute automatically
2. **Given** ast-grep finds code issues in report-only mode, **When** the scan completes, **Then** findings are visible in GitHub Security tab but do not block PR merging
3. **Given** Issue #31 is resolved and enforcement is enabled, **When** ast-grep finds violations, **Then** the CI pipeline fails and PR cannot merge
4. **Given** all quality checks pass, **When** CI completes, **Then** a success status is reported and PR can proceed to review

### Edge Cases

- What happens when CI jobs timeout? System must handle gracefully and report timeout status
- How does system handle when ast-grep configuration is invalid? CI must report configuration error without blocking other checks
- What happens during transition from report to enforce mode? Clear communication and grace period for teams to address existing issues

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST run SDD structure validation on every pull request to ensure compliance with project documentation standards
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute ast-grep code analysis using project's sgconfig.yml configuration on all code changes
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate SARIF-formatted reports from ast-grep findings for integration with GitHub Code Scanning
- **FR-004**: System MUST run language policy checks to ensure normative artifacts are in English
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute Rust quality gates including rustfmt, clippy with warnings as errors, and typos checking
- **FR-006**: System MUST run cargo tests across multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) to ensure cross-platform compatibility
- **FR-007**: System MUST support two operational modes: report-only (non-blocking) and enforcement (blocking) for ast-grep findings
- **FR-008**: System MUST upload scan results to GitHub Security tab for visibility and tracking
- **FR-009**: System MUST execute markdown style checks on documentation files
- **FR-010**: System MUST run semantic checks to validate cross-references and links in documentation

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: CI pipeline MUST complete within reasonable time limits (under 30 minutes for full suite)
- **NFR-002**: System MUST cache dependencies where appropriate to optimize build times
- **NFR-003**: Report-only mode MUST NOT block PR merging regardless of findings
- **NFR-004**: System MUST provide clear, actionable feedback for any validation failures
- **NFR-005**: Transition from report to enforcement mode MUST be configurable without code changes

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **CI Workflow**: The GitHub Actions workflow configuration that orchestrates all quality checks
- **Scan Results**: Code analysis findings from ast-grep in SARIF format for GitHub integration
- **Quality Report**: Aggregated results from all CI jobs including pass/fail status and details
- **Configuration State**: The current mode (report/enforce) and associated settings

---

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies

- **Issue #31**: Must be resolved before enabling enforcement mode for ast-grep
- **GitHub Code Scanning**: Must be enabled on repository for SARIF upload
- **Existing Scripts**: Relies on scripts in scripts/ci/ and scripts/sdd/ directories

### Assumptions

- Repository has sgconfig.yml properly configured for ast-grep
- GitHub Actions runners have necessary permissions for security scanning
- Development team is aware of two-stage rollout plan
