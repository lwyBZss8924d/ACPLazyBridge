NEW ISSUES(#xxx)-SDD-TASKs(#xxx):

"Initialize SDD Task 039 ‚Äì Align Streaming Notifications with ACP Models (Issue #45)"

- GitHub Issue: #45 ‚Äì Align Streaming Notifications with ACP Models
  Link: https://github.com/lwyBZss8924d/ACPLazyBridge/issues/45
- Pre-issue draft: dev-docs/_issues_drafts/open/#45-streaming-alignment-session-notifications.md
- Baseline (completed): Issue #44 / SDD Task 038 (PR #47) ‚Äì runtime adoption and Codex adapter migration
  Links: specs/038-adopt-acp-runtime/spec.md, specs/038-adopt-acp-runtime/plan.md, specs/038-adopt-acp-runtime/tasks.md; PR #47 merged commit 7ae26283f9ba8192180e4a17c6d2da4f718a3fb5
- Architecture baseline: dev-docs/architecture/acplb-architecture.md
- Core runtime design: dev-docs/core_servers/acplb-core-runtime.md
- Milestone tracking: dev-docs/_projects/migration-blueprint-project-management-plan.md and dev-docs/_requirements/{m1-issue-list.md,m1-technical-implementation-plan.md,acp-lazybridge-project-plan.md,acp-lazybridge-requirements.md}
- ACP references: https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol and https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/schema; agent-client-protocol crate (v0.4.2 as of 2025-09-22)
- ACP Agents adapter best practice (@zed-industries/claude-code-acp): [Claude Code SDK from ACP-compatible clients for Zed IDE external-agents Custom Agents as ACP client adapter] local path: (/Users/arthur/dev-space/claude-code-acp)
- ACP Repository docs local path: (~/dev-space/agent-client-protocol/docs)
- ACP official Rust library local path: (~/dev-space/agent-client-protocol/rust)

Objectives
- Replace bespoke streaming types in crates/codex-cli-acp with official agent_client_protocol models.
- Route all notifications via AgentSideConnection::session_notification.
- Preserve deduplication, notify sink parity, and idle-timeout behavior established in Task 038.

Acceptance criteria
- Snapshot tests assert ACP schema fidelity for SessionNotification, ContentBlock, ToolCall, and ToolCallUpdate.
- Notify and idle-timeout parity validated; Zed client smoke passes.
- Evidence for tests/logs/jq/reports stored under _artifacts/039-streaming-alignment/ and linked from SDD docs.

Deliverables you must produce
1) specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/spec.md
2) specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/plan.md
3) specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/tasks.md
x) specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/xxxx.md
x) ...

Hard requirements for all three files
- English-only (language-policy).
- Add a YAML-style metadata block at the top with:
  - date: current UTC timestamp in format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
  - Issue-URI: https://github.com/lwyBZss8924d/ACPLazyBridge/issues/45
  - Spec-URI or Plan-URI or Tasks-URI: self-referential path
  - Evidence-URIs: list of _artifacts/039-streaming-alignment/{tests,logs,jq,reports}/
- Cross-link the three docs (spec ‚Üî plan ‚Üî tasks) and the GitHub issue.
- Align with SDD Constitution Articles III (Test-First), VII (Simplicity), IX (Integration-First); call them out explicitly.
- Reference prior artefacts from Task 038 and explicitly note deferred items now in scope for #45.

Content guidance per file
- spec.md (WHAT/WHY):
  - Problem statement and motivation from the #45 draft.
  - Scope and out-of-scope exactly as the #45 draft states; include exclusions (composer plugins; legacy protocol removal tracked by #46).
  - Acceptance criteria and evidence expectations (as listed above).
  - Dependencies: PR #47 merged; architecture and runtime docs; agent-client-protocol crate version reference.
- plan.md (HOW, but no code):
  - Technical context: list crates/files likely to change:
    - crates/codex-cli-acp/src/{codex_proto.rs,codex_agent.rs,tool_calls.rs,notify_source.rs,validation.rs}
    - crates/acp-lazy-core/src/runtime/{server.rs,session.rs}
  - Data model mapping:
    - Replace bespoke SessionUpdate/ContentBlock/tool-call structs with official types.
    - Tool-call mapping: ToolCall and ToolCallUpdate with status transitions (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed/failed), raw IO/location metadata, and error mapping.
    - Deduplication logic operating on official types; document ordering and idempotency rules.
  - Test strategy:
    - Serde snapshots for all streamed official types.
    - Tool-call lifecycle (including error paths).
    - Malformed JSON handling and error classification.
    - Notify-triggered turn completion parity and idle-timeout parity.
    - JSONL replays if any baseline scenarios exist; store outputs under evidence paths.
  - Quality gates:
    - cargo fmt, cargo clippy, cargo test
    - scripts/ci/run-local-ci.sh
    - Optional ast-grep baselines per sdd-rules (no unwrap, no dbg, TODO markers).
- tasks.md (executable tasks):
  - TDD-first sequencing (write failing tests before implementation).
  - Explicit file paths; mark [P] for tasks that can be done in parallel.
  - Include evidence collection tasks, snapshot baselines, and CI gating tasks.
  - Include documentation updates and cross-link checks.

Worktree and branch (suggested; include in docs‚Äô metadata or notes)

Execution Plan

1. Create worktree structure:
  - Create worktree at /Users/arthur/dev-space/acplb-worktrees/039-streaming-alignment
  - Branch: feature/039-streaming-alignment from origin/main
  - Symbolic link at /Users/arthur/dev-space/ACPLazyBridge/.worktrees/039-streaming-alignment
2. Generate SDD documents:
  - specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/spec.md - Problem statement, acceptance criteria
  - specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/plan.md - Technical approach, data mapping
  - specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/tasks.md - Executable TDD tasks
3. Key changes to implement:
  - Replace SessionUpdate, ContentBlock, ToolCallStatus with official types
  - Use AgentSideConnection::session_notification for all notifications
  - Preserve deduplication, notify sink, and idle-timeout behavior
  - Add snapshot tests for ACP schema fidelity

Documents to Create

All three documents will:
- Include current UTC timestamps
- Reference Issue #45 and Task 038 artifacts
- Follow SDD Constitution Articles III (Test-First), VII (Simplicity), IX (Integration-First)
- Include evidence paths under _artifacts/039-streaming-alignment/

Created complete SDD documentation in /Users/arthur/dev-space/acplb-worktrees/039-streaming-alignment/:

Core Documents

- spec.md: Problem statement, requirements, and acceptance criteria for aligning streaming notifications with ACP models
- plan.md: Technical approach with constitution checks and implementation phases
- tasks.md: 47 executable tasks following TDD workflow (T001-T047)

Supporting Documents

- research.md: Type analysis and migration strategy
- data-model.md: Entity definitions and serialization requirements
- contracts/type_mappings.md: Binding contracts for type migration

Key Implementation Points

- Replace custom types with agent_client_protocol official types
- Maintain exact JSONL compatibility
- Preserve deduplication, notify, and timeout behavior from Task 038
- Follow Test-First Development (Article III)
- Use snapshot testing for JSON validation

- Reconciled spec.md/plan.md/tasks.md wording with the updated ACP-aligned data model and mapping contracts.
- Expanded Phase 3.2 test tasks to exercise the full `SessionUpdate` variant set and richer `ContentBlock`/`ToolCall` structures.
- Cross-checked documentation against `agent-client-protocol` v0.4.2 sources and reran targeted metadata validation (`data-model.md`, `contracts/type_mappings.md`, `research.md`).
- Marked Dev_Cooking_Phase status to "ready"; Phase 3.1 (T001‚ÄìT006) is the next execution step.

""""
- Integrated Issue #45 fallback-removal scope across spec/plan/tasks, aligned acceptance criteria, and clarified the existing last-chunk deduplication strategy.
- Refreshed Phase 3.1 setup tasks to review existing documentation instead of recreating artifacts; updated supporting docs (research/data-model/contracts) to match.
- Added per-document metadata entries (including jq evidence path) for spec/plan/tasks/research/data-model/contracts and confirmed with targeted `validate-metadata.sh` runs.
- Note: repo-wide metadata validation still reports legacy failures outside Task 039; follow-up needed before project-level compliance checks.

> Reviewed the Task‚ÄØ039 SDD docs‚Äîfound a few blockers before implementation can start:

  - Blocking ‚Äì Both plan.md and tasks.md omit the _artifacts/039-streaming-alignment/jq/ evidence path mandated in the task log, so the metadata gate
  will fail (specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/plan.md:11-14, specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/tasks.md:11-14,
  requirement spelled out in specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/ISSUES-SDD-TASK-logs.txt:82-133).
  - Blocking ‚Äì The issue draft calls out removing the simulated fallback in CodexProviderAdapter::spawn_and_stream_codex, but the current spec scope
  never commits to that deliverable; the scope stops at type swaps (dev-docs/_issues_drafts/open/#45-streaming-alignment-session-notifications.md:62-
  64 vs. specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/spec.md:82-99). Please add that requirement (and corresponding plan/tasks coverage) so
  the spec matches Issue‚ÄØ#45.
  - Major ‚Äì Phase‚ÄØ3.1 tasks still instruct the engineer to ‚Äúcreate‚Äù research.md, data-model.md, and contracts/type_mappings.md, even though those
  artefacts already exist and are marked complete; this will send the implementer in circles (specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/
  tasks.md:65-70 vs. specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/research.md:4-9). Rephrase those tasks (or mark them done) to reflect the
  current state.
  - Major ‚Äì The data-model doc defines a new ChunkDeduplicator based on HashSet<ContentBlock>, but the current adapter still deduplicates by
  remembering only the last emitted string chunk (specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/data-model.md:175-194 vs. crates/codex-cli-acp/
  src/codex_proto.rs:327-358). Either explain the planned migration in the spec/plan/tasks or update the data-model to match reality; right now the
  contract is inconsistent with the code and planned work.

 - Updated spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md so their wording now matches the ACP v0.4.2 data model: FR-039-01 points to SessionNotification/
  SessionUpdate, tasks call for exercising all official SessionUpdate and ContentBlock variants, and timestamps reflect the latest edits. (files:
  specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
  - Refined data-model.md, contracts/type_mappings.md, and research.md to mirror ACP source definitions (session updates, content blocks, tool-
  call structures, stop reasons, dedup guard). These documents now describe exactly what‚Äôs in agent-client-protocol v0.4.2. (files: data-model.md,
  contracts/type_mappings.md, research.md)

  Logs & Workflow

  - Bumped ISSUES-SDD-TASK-logs.txt: Dev_Cooking_Phase is marked ‚Äúready,‚Äù and a fresh log entry captures the doc reconciliation and schema
  verification. (file: ISSUES-SDD-TASK-logs.txt)

  Verification

  - Ran ./scripts/sdd/validate-metadata.sh --file ‚Ä¶ --verbose for data-model.md, contracts/type_mappings.md, and research.md; all returned ‚úì‚ÄØValid.
  - Cross-referenced the updates with ~/dev-space/agent-client-protocol/rust/{client.rs, content.rs, tool_call.rs} to ensure parity with ACP v0.4.2.

  Next Steps

  1. Kick off Dev_Cooking_Phase by tackling Phase‚ÄØ3.1 setup tasks T001‚ÄìT006 (insta dependency, test scaffolding, doc spot-checks).
  2. Before coding, plan the failing tests in Phase‚ÄØ3.2‚Äîespecially snapshots for the newly enumerated SessionUpdate and ContentBlock variants.

  All touched files are staged and ready if you‚Äôd like to commit this documentation pass.

  - ‚úÖ Initial phase is now closed: docs reviewed, scope aligned (fallback removal + last-chunk dedup), metadata validated, and the worklog entry
  committed (Initial_Phase).
  - üìå Handoff: we‚Äôre ready to move into the ‚ÄúResearch and Review (specs/)‚Äù / ‚ÄúDev_Cooking_Phase‚Äù track‚Äînext tangible actions start with Phase‚ÄØ3.1
  setup tasks (T001‚ÄìT006). Let me know when you want me to dive into those.

- Completed Phase 3.1 setup (T001‚ÄìT006): added `insta` as a dev-dependency, introduced the shared `SnapshotHarness`, and scaffolded `streaming_snapshots_test.rs` + `tool_call_lifecycle_test.rs` with passing smoke tests.
- Refreshed research/data-model/contracts with ACP v0.4.2 details (SessionUpdate fields, LastChunkGuard notes, tool-call mappings) and updated metadata timestamps to 2025-09-25T10:14:27Z.
- Expanded plan.md with a dedicated Phase 3.2 test-planning section and annotated tasks.md so each test track lists expected failure modes and evidence capture locations.
- Ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo test -p codex-cli-acp --tests`; harness compiles cleanly (warnings noted for unused `ingest_raw` helper until Phase 3.2 uses it).
"""

date: 2025-09-25T10:49:22Z
‚è∫ owner: AI-Engineer("codex")
"""
- Implemented Phase 3.2 RED coverage:
  - streaming_snapshots_test.rs exercises SessionNotification + ContentBlock variants via insta inline snapshots; current mapper fails JSON->ACP deserialization (missing SessionId) as expected.
  - tool_call_lifecycle_test.rs adds lifecycle/error/notify/idle tests; parse checks panic today and the notify/idle guards remain todo! until official stopReason wiring lands.
  - jsonl_regression_test.rs now rejects the legacy toolCallId schema; serde_json::from_value::<SessionNotification> panics with `missing field `sessionId``.
- Verified failures with `cargo test -p codex-cli-acp --tests` plus focused runs for streaming/tool lifecycle suites (evidence will live under `_artifacts/039-streaming-alignment/tests/` once snapshots are regenerated post-implementation).
- Updated tasks checklist (T007‚ÄìT016) to reflect authored tests; noted outstanding todo! in T015/T016 for stopReason alignment.

  Notes / follow-ups:

  1. Replace the bespoke structs in codex_proto.rs/tool_calls.rs with the official agent_client_protocol models so these tests turn green, then
  regenerate insta baselines.
  2. Flesh out the notify_completion_* and idle_timeout_* tests once stop-reason events emit ACP-aligned payloads.
  3. ./scripts/sdd/validate-metadata.sh --file specs/039-streaming-alignment-session-notifications/{plan,tasks}.md still reports ‚ÄúNo
  metadata‚Äù (unchanged template issue).

‚è∫ owner: AI-Engineer("codex")
"""
- Phase 3.3 core refactor (T017‚ÄìT027) complete: codex_proto.rs now emits `agent_client_protocol::SessionNotification`/`SessionUpdate` directly, content/tool-call mapping uses the official models, and the last-chunk dedup guard was retained with ACP-compliant payloads. Tool kind inference returns `ToolKind` enums and enriched raw IO/location metadata is attached to each tool call.
- Phase 3.4 integration (T028‚ÄìT032) finished: codex_agent.rs streams the new notification structs, notify/idle paths reuse the official `StopReason`, and error propagation surfaces ACP-formatted `ToolCallUpdate` failures. The simulated fallback branch is removed.
- Updated snapshot and regression tests to the v0.4.2 JSON shape; regenerated inline insta baselines and rewrote the session_update_format assertions for the flattened schema. All suites pass via `cargo test -p codex-cli-acp --tests`.
- tasks.md reflects the completed items (T017‚ÄìT032 checked, timestamp bumped); next actionable work is the Phase 3.5 polish set (T034+) plus validation T041‚ÄìT047. Manual Zed smoke test (T033) and SDD tooling runs remain outstanding.
