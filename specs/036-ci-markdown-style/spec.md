## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Issue #28: Add GitHub Actions job for markdown style enforcement
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: CI job, markdown validation, blocking check, local-first approach
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked: Initial mode (report-only vs blocking)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow and CI verification scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí N/A - Configuration only, no data entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All sections complete, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer contributing to ACPLazyBridge, I want automated markdown quality checks in CI so that I receive immediate feedback on documentation issues and can fix them locally before my PR is merged, ensuring consistent documentation quality across the project.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer creates a PR with markdown files, **When** the CI runs, **Then** the markdown style job executes and reports violations if any exist

2. **Given** markdown violations are detected in CI, **When** the job completes, **Then** it provides clear instructions to run local tools for fixing

3. **Given** all markdown files pass style checks, **When** the CI job completes, **Then** the PR check shows as passed

4. **Given** the job is in report-only mode initially, **When** violations are found, **Then** the PR can still be merged while team adapts

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no markdown files are changed? ‚Üí Job should skip or complete quickly
- How does system handle very large markdown files? ‚Üí Timeout protection should exist
- What if markdownlint configuration is missing? ‚Üí Job should fail with clear error message

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST run markdown style checks on every pull request that modifies markdown files
- **FR-002**: System MUST use the existing `scripts/ci/run-markdown-style.sh` script for validation
- **FR-003**: System MUST display violation details in the GitHub Actions log
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear instructions for developers to fix issues locally
- **FR-005**: System MUST support a transition period with non-blocking mode
- **FR-006**: System MUST only run when markdown files (`**/*.md`) are modified in the PR
- **FR-007**: System MUST complete validation within reasonable time limits (< 2 minutes)
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate with existing PR status checks
- **FR-009**: Configuration MUST allow disabling specific markdown rules that don't align with project needs
- **FR-010**: System MUST upload results as artifacts for review
