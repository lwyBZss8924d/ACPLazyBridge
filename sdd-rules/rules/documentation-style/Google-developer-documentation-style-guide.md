# Google Developer Documentation Style Guide

## Text Style

- Use an imperative style. "Run a prompt using the API."
- Use sentence case in titles/headings.
- Use short titles/headings: "Download the data", "Call the API", "Process the results".
- Use the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
- Use second person: "you" rather than "we".
- When using links between notebooks, use relative ones as they'll work better in IDEs and Colab. Use absolute ones to link to folders or markdown files.
