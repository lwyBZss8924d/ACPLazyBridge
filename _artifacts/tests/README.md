# Tests Evidence

Store task-specific test artefacts here (e.g., JSONL fixtures, test logs):
- `_artifacts/tests/<task>/test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- `_artifacts/tests/<task>/fixtures/*.jsonl`

Use `_artifacts/tests/protocol-baseline/` for shared playback fixtures consumed by integration tests. Legacy fixtures in `_artifacts/tests/legacy/` remain read-only.
