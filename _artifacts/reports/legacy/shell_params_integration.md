# Shell Parameters Integration Complete

## Overview

Successfully integrated the ExtractedShellParams functionality into the tool call processing pipeline, eliminating dead code warnings and enhancing tool call metadata.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Tool Call Processing (`codex_proto.rs`)

- Now uses `extract_shell_params` to extract comprehensive shell parameters
- Enhanced title to show workdir when different from session cwd
- Added locations field with workdir for IDE navigation features
- Enhanced raw_input to include both original and extracted parameters for debugging

### 2. Code Quality Improvements (`tool_calls.rs`)

- Refactored `extract_shell_params` to use idiomatic Rust patterns
- Eliminated clippy warnings about field reassignment
- Improved readability with chained Option methods

## Features Added

### Enhanced Title Display

Shell commands now show their working directory in the title:

- Before: `local_shell: npm test`
- After: `local_shell: npm test (in /project)`

### Location Tracking

Tool calls now include location metadata for IDE features:

```json
{
  "locations": [{
    "path": "/project",
    "type": "directory"
  }]
}
```

### Enhanced Debug Information

The raw_input field now includes extracted parameters:

```json
{
  "raw_input": {
    "original": { "command": ["npm", "test"], "workdir": "/project" },
    "extracted": {
      "command": "npm test",
      "workdir": "/project",
      "timeout_ms": 30000,
      "with_escalated_permissions": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Test Results

- All 39 tests passing
- No clippy warnings
- Code properly formatted

## Benefits

1. **No Dead Code**: ExtractedShellParams and extract_shell_params are now actively used
2. **Better UX**: Users can see working directory context in tool titles
3. **IDE Integration**: Location tracking enables IDE follow-along features
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Extracted parameters visible in raw_input for troubleshooting
5. **Field Compatibility**: Supports multiple field name conventions (workdir/cwd/working_directory)

## Compliance

- ✅ ACP v1 protocol compliant
- ✅ Full Codex ShellToolCallParams support
- ✅ Semantic error mapping maintained
- ✅ UTF-8 safe output handling preserved
